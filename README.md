# Fix My Code Challenge

> Fix my code is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!
Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not. We don't intend to recode everthing. Just fixing it will be cool

The buggy code can be found [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/master)
